# TDD Check Script - MANDATORY AND NON-BYPASSABLE

# - Locked tests are DELIVERED features (immutable)
# - If tests fail, fix IMPLEMENTATION, NOT tests
# - Tests define what "working" means
#
# ⚠️  BYPASS PROHIBITED: This script cannot be skipped or bypassed
# ⚠️  AI AGENTS: You cannot bypass this check - tests must pass
# ⚠️  Even with --no-verify, server-side checks will block

# Usage:
