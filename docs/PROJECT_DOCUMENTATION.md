## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

**Expense Splitting Complexity**
- Manually tracking who paid for what becomes tedious in group settings
- Calculating splits (equal, percentage, custom amounts) is error-prone
- No easy way to see who owes whom at a glance
- Settling up requires manual calculations and multiple conversations
- No historical record of expenses and settlements

**Platform Limitations**
- Existing solutions (Splitwise, Venmo, etc.) require:
  - Account creation and verification
  - Sharing personal financial information
  - Dependency on internet connectivity
  - Privacy concerns with third-party services
  - Platform lock-in

**User Pain Points**
- Roommates splitting rent, utilities, groceries
- Friends splitting restaurant bills, travel expenses
- Event organizers managing group expenses
- Family members tracking shared household costs
- Need for offline functionality
- Desire for privacy and data ownership

### Target Users

1. **Roommates** - Sharing living expenses
2. **Friends** - Splitting social expenses (dinners, trips, events)
3. **Families** - Managing household expenses
4. **Event Organizers** - Tracking group event costs

```

### Data Models

#### Core Entities

**Group**
```typescript
{
  id: string
  name: string
  description?: string
  members: Member[]
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

**Member**
```typescript
{
  id: string
  groupId: string
  name: string
  email?: string
  avatar?: string
  joinedAt: Date
}
```

**Expense**
```typescript
{
  id: string
  groupId: string
  paidBy: string // memberId
  amount: number
  description: string
  category: string
  date: Date
  splits: ExpenseSplit[]
  settled: boolean
  createdAt: Date
}
```

**ExpenseSplit**
```typescript
{
  id: string
  expenseId: string
  memberId: string
  amount: number
  percentage?: number
  settled: boolean
}
```

**Balance**
```typescript
{
  memberId: string
  groupId: string
  totalOwed: number // positive = owes, negative = owed to
  expenses: Expense[]
}
```

### Code Quality & Enforcement

#### Strict Enforcement Mechanisms
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Linting, type checking, build validation, tests
- **Pre-push Hooks**: Branch protection
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline with PR checks
- **Version Management**: Automatic version bumping
- **Test Lock System**: TDD approach with locked tests
- **Enforcement Lock System**: Protection against bypassing checks

#### Quality Standards
- Zero tolerance for bypassing checks
- All production code must pass linting
- Type safety enforced (TypeScript/Kotlin)
- Build must succeed before commit
- **Responsive design MANDATORY** - All UI must work on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Tests must pass (TDD approach)
- Version bump required for every PR
